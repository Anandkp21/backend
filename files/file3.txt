CONGRATULATIONS! You've successfully completed the JWT challenge!

FLAG: CTF{JwT_4lG0r!ThM_N0n3_@tt@ck_Succ3ssfu1}


You bypassed the JWT authentication by exploiting a vulnerability in the token verification.
This is a common vulnerability when JWT libraries are improperly configured to accept
the "none" algorithm, essentially bypassing signature verification.

In a real application, this could allow attackers to escalate privileges and access
sensitive data or functionality reserved for administrators.

Remember these security best practices for JWT implementation:
1. Always validate the signature with a strong secret key
2. Never accept the "none" algorithm in production
3. Implement proper algorithm validation
4. Use a whitelist approach for algorithms
5. Include expiration times in tokens
