User Instructions:

1. You've successfully logged in as a regular user
2. You can view this file and file1.txt
3. There's a third file (file3.txt) that only admins can access
4. To complete the challenge, find a way to access file3.txt

Hint: Take a close look at the JWT token and how it's being verified.
Remember that JWT consists of three parts: header.payload.signature

Can you manipulate the token to gain admin privileges?
